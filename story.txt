It was the third week of class and Diddy Doodat was in a really good mood. He was on his way to CS 400 at the Noland Zoology Building, ready to learn about somce data structures, when   the clouds appeared from no where and lightning struck the sky. Diddy, scared out of his     mind, rushed into the buliding to escape the thunder. When he walked into the lecture hall,  Professer Kuemmel stood menacingly at the front of the classroom as he uttered the words, "Class P2 has been released."

Diddy Doodat was shocked and his good mood instantly evaporated. First the lightning, and now the impending P2, Diddy Doodat just can't seem to catch
a break. Witnessing Diddy Doodat's troubled expression, Professor Kuemmel grinned mischievously as he added "This program will not just include Binary Search Trees but also AVL trees !". Professor Kuemmel turned to Dilly Doodat to examine his reaction. Diddy Doodat was frightened, but suddenly a he felt a surge of motivation. He looked straight into Professor Kuemmel's eyes as if to say "Bring it on,professor. I am ready to face any task that you present ".
