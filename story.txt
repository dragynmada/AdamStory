It was the third week of class and Diddy Doodat was in a really good mood. He was on his way to CS 400 at the Noland Zoology Building, ready to learn about somce data structures, when   the clouds appeared from no where and lightning struck the sky. Diddy, scared out of his     mind, rushed into the buliding to escape the thunder. When he walked into the lecture hall,  Professer Kuemmel stood menacingly at the front of the classroom as he uttered the words, "Class P2 has been released."
